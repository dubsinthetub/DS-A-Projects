# CLI-Based Contacts Application Overview
 * This is a simple CLI (Command Line Interface) based Contacts Organizer developed using Java and a Binary Search Tree Map as the underlying Data Structure. All classes have been implemented from scratch as an exercise for better understanding Data Structures and Algorithms. This application also utilizes Gradle for building, testing, and running. Please view the below steps if you would like to understand how to use the application using Gradle!

## Dependencies
 * JDK 20+
 * Gradle

## Building the Application
Before running the application, you should execute a Gradle build to ensure the latest code version and jar file is being used. This can be done by running the following on your terminal:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Running Locally
After executing the build, simply run this command on a terminal in your application's directory to run locally:
```bash
./gradlew run
```

## Viewing Tests
In order to see all of the tests and passing tests, you can execute a Gradle test command, but the application should also direct you to a link of passing tests after you execute your build:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Sample Program Output
Included as "SampleOutput.txt". If the program is ran using Gradle, an identical output can be produced in the console. The .txt file tests all cases addressed in the program for managaing the contact directory. Sample data of randomly chosen Artemis astronauts is used in this sample output.
